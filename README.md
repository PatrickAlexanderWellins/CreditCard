# Credit Card Fraud Detection Capstone Project

This project provides an example of how machine learning is employed to classify credit card charges as fraudulent or genuine. The programming language used for this project is Python.

## Python Libraries

These Python libraries that are in bold are used in the project for statistical techniques, machine learning models, data processing, and visualization.

**pandas, random, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot,IPython.display, scipy, statistics, warnings, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.**

## Custom library

I programmed a few functions that converted seconds in to hours, and a few functions to find the frequencies of leading digits. The file timer contains these functions.
